Milestone 4 Deliverable (of 4 total)

Since the last deliverable, we have implemented a custom UK version of the Monopoly game, where players can choose to play either the normal version or the UK version. We have also implemented a save/load feature, where players can save their current game and load it through reading an XML file. More smelly code was also addressed.

The current implementation focuses on a GUI with a jail system, ability to buy properties, railroads and utilities. Players can go around the board and each move/roll of the die has an animation that really makes the Monopoly game feel life-like. On the side bar, the list of players and their owned properties/money balance is listed. Each option the player is given, whether it would be to pass/roll or buy a new property, is given as a pop up. A player can purchase and sell houses for any given property that they own. A player can also choose to save the current game to play later and load it back up when they launch the game again. 

The players can also choose to play with AIs. The AIs may not be the smartest, but they can stir up the game and make choices that can affect a human player's thinking!

As of now, there are no known issues with the full version of the game. Milestone 4 has been tested and fully implemented with no known bugs.

This has been a fun project to work on, and we were excited to tackle it and learn a lot from doing so. ~ MC
