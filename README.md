Milestone 2 Deliverable (of 4 total)

Since the last deliverable, we have implemented a GUI for the Monopoly game. This required us to add the controller and the view. It is essentially the same game in a GUI format. Behind the scenes, JUnit testing and refactoring was completed to ensure full, proper functionality of the game.

The current implementation focuses on a GUI with a jail system, ability to buy properties, railroads and utilities. Players can go around the board and each move/roll of the die has an animation that really makes the Monopoly game feel life-like. On the side bar, the list of players and their owned properties/money balance is listed. Each option the player is given, whether it would be to pass/roll or buy a new property, is given as a pop up.

Unfortunately, we had major issues with the housing system implementation. Since it is not a requirement until the next milestone, we figured it'd be better to leave it out and spend most of our focus on it in the near future. There are still a couple of known minor issues with the jail system, such as being let out of jail early before posting bail after rolling 3 times, that will be addressed in the next milestone. Other than this, the Milestone 2 has been tested and fully implemented with no known bugs.

Over the next week or two, we will be reworking the housing system to make it fully functional and abiding by the classic rules of Monopoly. We will also implement intelligent, dynamic AIs.

In Milestone 4, we will be implementing a save/load feature, as well as an international version with custom street names, values, and currencies.
