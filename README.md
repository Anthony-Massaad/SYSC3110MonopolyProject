Milestone 3 Deliverable (of 4 total)

Since the last deliverable, we have implemented the housing system (which is now fully functional) and very basic AIs. Behind the scenes, more JUnit testing and refactoring was completed to ensure full, proper functionality of the game. Smelly code was also addressed.

The current implementation focuses on a GUI with a jail system, ability to buy properties, railroads and utilities. Players can go around the board and each move/roll of the die has an animation that really makes the Monopoly game feel life-like. On the side bar, the list of players and their owned properties/money balance is listed. Each option the player is given, whether it would be to pass/roll or buy a new property, is given as a pop up. There is also the option for a player to purchase and sell houses.

The only issue with our project is the AI. The AIs cannot really do anything other than roll around the board. In Milestone 4, we plan on making these AIs act like a human and be able to make specific choices. Other than this, the Milestone 3 has been tested and fully implemented with no known bugs.

Over the next week or two (during the final milestone), we will be implementing a save/load feature, as well as an international version with custom street names, values, and currencies. These will be the final additions to the project before it is complete. 

*note to Michael: We did our best to equally distribute the workload. It shows a lot better in the commits. ~ MC
